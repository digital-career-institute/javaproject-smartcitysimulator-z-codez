Here's a high-level overview of the project structure:

Here's a breakdown of the components:

SmartCitySimulation.java: The main class of the simulation that starts and manages the different aspects of the smart city simulation.

TrafficManagement.java: Simulates smart traffic management, including traffic lights, congestion detection, and rerouting of vehicles. You can use a CSV file (traffic_data.csv) to represent traffic data.

SmartLighting.java: Simulates smart lighting in the city, where street lights adjust their brightness based on the time of day and sensor data.

EnvironmentalMonitoring.java: Simulates environmental monitoring, including air quality, noise levels, and temperature.

traffic_data.csv: A sample data file for simulating traffic data. You can expand this to include more complex traffic data.

opencsv-5.5.2.jar: The OpenCSV library for reading and writing CSV files. You'll need to add this library to your project to handle the traffic data CSV file.

here is simplified implementation
```
public class SmartCitySimulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TrafficManagement trafficManagement = new TrafficManagement();
        SmartLighting smartLighting = new SmartLighting();
        EnvironmentalMonitoring environmentalMonitoring = new EnvironmentalMonitoring();

        // Start simulation components using multithreading
        Thread trafficThread = new Thread(trafficManagement);
        Thread lightingThread = new Thread(smartLighting);
        Thread monitoringThread = new Thread(environmentalMonitoring);

        trafficThread.start();
        lightingThread.start();
        monitoringThread.start();

        // Add exception handling for each component
        try {
            trafficThread.join();
            lightingThread.join();
            monitoringThread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}


```
You'll need to add logic to read and process the data from the CSV file, simulate traffic flow, control street lights, and monitor environmental conditions based on your specific requirements.

1. TrafficManagement.java: Simulates smart traffic management, including traffic lights, congestion detection, and rerouting of vehicles. It will demonstrate collections and input/output for reading data from a CSV file.
```
   import java.util.List;

public class TrafficManagement implements Runnable {
    private List<Vehicle> vehicles;

    public void run() {
        // Read traffic data from CSV
        // Implement traffic management logic using collections
        // Handle exceptions for I/O operations
    }
}
```

2. SmartLighting.java: Simulates smart lighting in the city, where street lights adjust their brightness based on the time of day and sensor data. It will demonstrate time handling.
 ```
public class SmartLighting implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // Implement smart lighting logic
        // Adjust street light brightness based on time and sensor data
    }
}


```
4. EnvironmentalMonitoring.java: Simulates environmental monitoring, including air quality, noise levels, and temperature. It will demonstrate loops and time handling.
```
public class EnvironmentalMonitoring implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // Implement environmental monitoring logic
        // Monitor air quality, noise levels, temperature, etc.
    }
}

```
5.  Vehicle.java: Represents a vehicle in the simulation
   In your smart city simulation project, you can use the Vehicle class to represent and manage vehicles within the simulation. Here are some scenarios where you can use the Vehicle class:

Traffic Management: Within the TrafficManagement class, you can create instances of the Vehicle class to simulate vehicles moving in the city. You can update the vehicles' positions, manage traffic lights, and simulate traffic congestion. For example, you can create instances of different types of vehicles (e.g., cars, buses, bicycles) and update their positions based on traffic flow and congestion.

Vehicle Tracking: You can use the Vehicle class to track and monitor the movement and behavior of vehicles. For instance, you can record the current speed, registration numbers, and types of vehicles. This information can be used to analyze traffic patterns and congestion.

Environmental Monitoring: If your simulation includes factors like vehicle emissions or noise pollution, you can use the Vehicle class to model these aspects. Each vehicle can contribute to environmental data, and you can update the environmental monitoring sensors based on the presence and behavior of vehicles.
```
public class Vehicle {
    private String vehicleType;
    private String registrationNumber;
    private double currentSpeed;

    public Vehicle(String vehicleType, String registrationNumber) {
       // to do
    }

    public void accelerate(double speedIncrease) {
      // to do
    }

    public void brake(double speedDecrease) {
       //to do
    }

    public double getCurrentSpeed() {
        return currentSpeed;
    }

    public String getVehicleType() {
        return vehicleType;
    }

    public String getRegistrationNumber() {
        return registrationNumber;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
      // to do
    }
}


```
7.  Sensor.java: Represents a sensor used for environmental monitoring
 It has a sensorType field to specify the type of sensor (e.g., "Air Quality," "Noise Level," or "Temperature").

It has a currentValue field to store the current measured value of the sensor.

The measure method simulates measuring data by generating random values depending on the sensor type. You can replace the random value generation with actual sensor data reading in a real application.

The getCurrentValue method allows you to retrieve the current value measured by the sensor.

The getSensorType method returns the sensor type.

The toString method provides a string representation of the sensor for easy debugging and printing.

You can expand and customize this Sensor class to include more advanced features or integrate it with your environmental monitoring logic in the EnvironmentalMonitoring class as mentioned in your smart city simulation project.
```
public class Sensor {
    private String sensorType;
    private double currentValue;

    public Sensor(String sensorType) {
        this.sensorType = sensorType;
        this.currentValue = 0.0;
    }

    public void measure() {
        // Simulate measuring data by generating random values
        Random rand = new Random();

        if ("Air Quality".equals(sensorType)) {
            currentValue = rand.nextDouble() * 100; // Random value between 0 and 100
        } else if ("Noise Level".equals(sensorType)) {
            currentValue = rand.nextDouble() * 120; // Random value between 0 and 120 (in decibels)
        } else if ("Temperature".equals(sensorType)) {
            currentValue = rand.nextDouble() * 40 - 10; // Random value between -10 and 30 degrees Celsius
        }
    }

    public double getCurrentValue() {
        return currentValue;
    }

    public String getSensorType() {
        return sensorType;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        //to do
    }
}
```
